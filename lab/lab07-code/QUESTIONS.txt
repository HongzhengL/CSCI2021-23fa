Lab Instructions
================

  Follow the instructions below to experiment with topics related to
  this lab.
  - For sections marked QUIZ, fill in an (X) for the appropriate
    response in this file. Use the command `make test-quiz' to see if
    all of your answers are correct.
  - For sections marked CODE, complete the code indicated. Use the
    command `make test-code' to check if your code is complete.
  - DO NOT CHANGE any parts of this file except the QUIZ sections as it
    may interfere with the tests otherwise.
  - If your `QUESTIONS.txt' file seems corrupted, restore it by copying
    over the `QUESTIONS.txt.bak' backup file.
  - When you complete the exercises, check your answers with `make test'
    and if all is well, create a zip file with `make zip' and upload it
    to Gradescope. Ensure that the Autograder there reflects your local
    results.
  - IF YOU WORK IN A GROUP only one member needs to submit and then add
    the names of their group.


QUIZ Coding Assembly Functions
==============================

  Answer the following questions on stack manipulation and function
  calls in assembly.


Growing the Stack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Which of the following instructions can be used to extend / grow the
  stack?
  - ( ) `subq $20, %rsp`
  - ( ) `pushq $99`
  - ( ) `pushl %ebx`
  - (X) All of the above


`callq` effects on Stack Pointer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  When calling a function via the `callq', the stack pointer `%rsp' must
  be "aligned", i.e., divisible by 16. Assuming this is so, how does the
  `callq' instruction change `%rsp'?

  - ( ) `callq' does not change `%rsp' at all. `%rsp' is
    therefore still divisible by 16 after the instruction completes.
  - (X) `callq' will subtract off 8 from the value of `%rsp' and places
    the return address at the top of the stack. `%rsp' is then divisible
    by 8 but not 16.
  - ( ) `callq' will subtract off 16 from the value of `%rsp' and places
    the return address at the top of the stack. `%rsp' is therefore
    still divisible by 16.
  - ( ) `callq' will subtract off 24 from the value of `%rsp' and places
    the return address at the top of the stack. `%rsp' is then divisible
    by 8 but not 16.


Alignment
~~~~~~~~~

  If the total size of local variables that need main memory space in a
  function is 36 bytes, one approach is to grow the stack by 36 bytes
  exactly. BUT if functions are to be called during that function, then
  it would be better to...
  - ( ) No special action is required: growing by 36 bytes is a good
    idea as it saves memory while growing larger would waste memory.
  - ( ) No special action is required: the `callq' instruction
    automatically changes `%rsp' to be a value that is divisible by 16.
  - ( ) Grow the stack by 48 bytes; this will mean `%rsp' is aligned at
    a 16-byte boundary and ready for function calls.
  - (X) Grow the stack by 40 bytes; this + 8 bytes for the return
    address in the stack will mean `%rsp' is aligned at a 16-byte
    boundary and ready for function calls.


CODE order3.s
=================

  Complete the `main()' function in `order3_asm.s'. This will require
  completing the `TODO' sections in the code to grow the stack, populate
  the stack with local variable values, call several functions with the
  addresses of local variables, and then shrink the stack.

  To help understand the intent of the assembly code, you can analyze
  the equivalent C code in `order3.c' which performs the same
  "computation" in C including use of the address-of operator.

  When written correctly, the program should compile and run as follows.
  ,----
  | > make
  | gcc -Wall -Werror -g -o order3_c order3.c
  | gcc -Wall -Werror -g -o order3_asm order3.s
  |
  | > ./order3_asm
  | r t v: 12 13 17
  | q e d:  2  5  9
  | i j k: 24 27 29
  `----

  If mistakes in the stack manipulation are present, this can lead to
  problems later in the program. Valgrind can give a little insight but
  generally these are difficult problems to diagnose, so be careful. For
  example, below is a transcript of an incorrectly written version which
  does not allocate the correct amount of space in the stack for the
  local variables.
