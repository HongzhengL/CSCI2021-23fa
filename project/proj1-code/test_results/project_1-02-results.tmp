== Test 2: Check for End of Input
== Checks that the main() loop detects EOF when scanning typed input and exits.
== When working interactively in a Unix terminal typing Ctrl-d (Control "d")
== will indicate the end of input. When piping a script in this happens
== automatically. If this test fails, ensure main() is looking for EOF on
== scanf()/fscanf() calls and exits when detected.
