PROBLEM 1: Basic Library Linking
================================

(A)
~~~

  The file `do_math.c' contains some basic usage of the C library math
  functions like `pow()'.  Compile this program using the command line
  ,----
  | > gcc do_math.c
  `----
  and show the results below (there should be an error). Describe why
  the linker complains about functions like `cos' and `pow'.

  *Note*: problems will arise on Linux systems with gcc; compilation with
  other compilers and/or on other operating systems may not suffer from the
  same problems.


(B)
~~~

  In order to fix this problem, one must link the program against the
  math library typically called `libm'. This can be done with the option
  `-l' for "library" and `m' for the math library as shown:
  ,----
  | > gcc do_math.c -lm
  `----

  Show a run of the resulting executable after a successful compile
  below.


(C)
~~~

  After successfully compiling `do_math.c', use the `ldd' command to examine
  which dynamically linked libraries it requires to run. Assuming the
  executable is named `a.out', invoke the command like this
  ,----
  | > ldd a.out
  `----
  Show the output for this command and note anything related to the math
  library that is reported.


(D)
~~~

  Run the program which should report its Process ID (pid) before
  pausing.  In a separate terminal, while the program is still running,
  execute the pmap command to see the virtual address space for the
  program (command `pmap <pid>'). Paste the results below and describe
  any relation to the math library that is apparent.


PROBLEM 2: Linking Static Libraries
===================================

(A)
~~~

  Libraries come in two flavors. The default type is Dynamically Linked
  Shared Libraries that were demonstrated above.  An older but easier to
  understand type are Statically Linked libraries.

  A few useful search functions, like `binary_array_search()',
  have been formed into a Statically Linked Library in the directory
  `ds_search_static/'.

  Change into this directory and perform a
  ,----
  | > make
  `----
  to build the library.

  Describe the commands you see issued for it and what command creates
  the final library file. Note what file extension (`lib.something') the
  static library has in your answer.


(B)
~~~

  Change back to the main homework directory where you will find a file
  called `do_search.c' which uses search functions from the
  library. Attempting to compile this program on its own leads to
  several errors.  The first is simple:
  ,----
  | > gcc do_search.c
  | do_search.c:6:10: fatal error: ds_search.h: No such file or directory
  |  #include "ds_search.h"
  |           ^~~~~~~~~~~~~
  | compilation terminated.
  `----
  Unable to find a header file to include, the compiler terminates.

  Fix this by telling the compiler where the `ds_search.h' file is in the
  library directory:

  ,----
  | > gcc do_search.c -I ds_search_static
  | ...
  `----

  The `-I' option allows additional directories to be searched for files
  referenced in `#include' directives. However, this is not the only problem.

  Show the linker errors that result from the compiling this way and
  describe why they appear.


(C)
~~~

  The compiler can be informed of additional places to look for library
  code beyond standard system locations with the `-L' option. In this
  case, the library `ds_search_static' contains the library. Finally,
  one must specify an additional library to link against,
  `libds_search.a' in this case (though invocation drops the `lib' and
  `.a' parts). Run the following command:

  ,----
  | > gcc do_search.c  -I ds_search_static  -L ds_search_static  -lds_search
  | #                  ^^ includes dir ^^^  ^^ libray dir ^^^^^  ^^lib name^
  `----

  and then run the resulting executable to show its output.


(D)
~~~

  Run the `nm' command to show the symbol names present in the resulting
  executable.  Verify that the text definitions for library functions
  required by `do_search.c' are present and well-defined.  Show your
  output for `nm'

  Are ALL functions from libds_search.a copied in or only those that are
  needed?


Problem 3: Creating Dynamically Linked Shared Libraries
=======================================================

(A)
~~~

  Dynamically Linked Shared Libraries differ from their static counterparts in
  that no definitions are copied into an executable. Instead, when creating
  programs using such libraries, definitions for the functions in the
  dynamically linked libraries are left undefined and marked as "link at
  runtime." On loading the program, the location of library code is mapped into
  the virtual address space of the program. Since multiple programs can map the
  same physical address into their virtual address space, only one copy of
  functions such as `printf()' needs to be in memory for the whole system.

  The provided code directory `ds_search_dynamic/' contains a `Makefile'
  which will build a shared object (.so) version of a data structure
  search library as follows.
  ,----
  | > cd ds_search_dynamic/
  |
  | > make
  | gcc -g -Wall -Werror -fpic -c tree.c
  | gcc -g -Wall -Werror -fpic -c array.c
  | gcc -g -Wall -Werror -fpic -c list.c
  | gcc -shared -o libds_search.so tree.o array.o list.o
  |
  | > file libds_search.so
  | libds_search.so: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, ...
  |
  | > cd ..
  `----

  Compile and link the provided `do_search.c' program against this
  library as follows.

  ,----
  | > gcc do_search.c -lds_search -I ds_search_dynamic -L ds_search_dynamic
  `----

  Run the `ldd' utility to see what dynamic library dependencies the
  resulting `a.out' program has and attempt to run it as shown.
  ,----
  | > ldd a.out
  | ...
  |
  | > ./a.out
  | ...
  `----

  Show the output for these commands.


(B)
~~~

  What problems did you encounter when running the program?

  Next, try running the program as follows:
  ,----
  | > LD_LIBRARY_PATH=ds_search_dynamic ./a.out
  `----

  What do you observe?

  LD_LIBRARY_PATH is an "environment variable" -- basically a setting for
  your current "session" with the OS -- that tells the linker where (in which
  directories) to search for dynamically-linked library dependencies.
