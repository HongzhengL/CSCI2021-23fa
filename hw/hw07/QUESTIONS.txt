Write your answers to the questions below directly in this text file to
prepare for the associated quiz.


PROBLEM 1: Quote Binary Debugging
=================================

  The two files `quote_main.c' and `quote_data.o' can be compiled
  together to form an executable as in the following.
  ,----
  | > gcc quote_main.c quote_data.o
  | > ./a.out
  | Complete this sentence by C++ creator Bjarne Stroustrup:
  | C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot; ...
  |
  | enter a number from 0 to 15: 2
  |
  | 2: This is why most programmers are such poor dancers.
  |
  | Have a nice tall glass of ... NOPE.
  `----
  As in a previous exercise, the intention is to use the debugger to
  detect the correct response. In this case however, the correct
  completion is present in `quote_main.c'. However, one must enter a
  number which selects from several responses in an attempt to match the
  correct completion. It is possible to "brute force" the solution by
  trying all solutions. However, the intent of the activity is to
  explore running code with the debugger to answer the questions
  below. This will give insight into some stages of the binary bomb
  assignment.


A
~

  Use some binary utility programs to print out the symbols that are
  present in `quote_data.o'.  Review the previous homework if you have
  forgotten programs like `nm' and `objdump' can print symbols in a
  binary object file. Speculate as to which data might pertain to where
  potential options are stored.


B
~

  The entry point into the assembly code in `quote_data.o' is the
  function `get_it'.  Use either the debugger or a disassembly of the
  object to trace whether this functions performs the entire computation
  or if other functions are also used. Use this along with other
  observations of the content of the `quote_data.o' file to infer what
  kind of data structure the choices are stored in.


C
~

  Use the debugger to step through the functions in `quote_data.o'.
  Keep in mind that the parameters to the function follow the standard
  convention: 1st param in register `%rdi', second in `%rsi', and so
  forth.  You should be able to identify a loop in a critical function
  in which the choices are present.

  Note that quote_data.o does *not* include debugging information, so gdb
  will not be able to show you the C source code it was compiled from. Instead,
  use commands like "layout asm" and "layout regs" in gdb's TUI mode to observe
  how this code runs at the assembly level. Refer to the GDB guide linked to
  from our Canvas home page for tips on debugging assembly.

  Use the `print' and `x' commands in gdb to examine data pointed to by
  registers to help identify where the correct response is located.

  Keep in mind that often the `testX' instruction is used to determine
  truthy/falsey qualities about a register. This takes several forms
  that were mentioned in lecture.
  - `testl %edx, %edx' may be used to check if `%edx' is 0 or negative
  - `testq %rax, %rax' may be used to check if `%rax' is a `NULL' pointer
  You are likely to see some of the above uses for the test instruction
  while examining the assembly code in `quote_data.o'

  Recall that you can examine memory addresses pointed to registers with
  gdb commands like the following.
  ,----
  | (gdb) x/d $rax   # print memory pointed to by rax as a decimal integer
  | (gdb) x/x $rax   # print memory pointed to by rax as a hex number
  | (gdb) x/s $rax   # print memory pointed to by rax as a string
  `----

  Include what debugger techniques you used in your answer along with
  the index of the correct completion.


PROBLEM 2: Stack Smashing
=========================

A
~

  Examine the obviously flawed code in `smash1.c'.
  ,----
  |  1  // smash1.c: demonstrates problems with the function call stack
  |  2  #include <stdio.h>
  |  3
  |  4  void fill_seq(int *a);
  |  5  void demo();
  |  6
  |  7  int main() {
  |  8      printf("About to do the demo\n");
  |  9      demo();
  | 10      printf("Demo Complete\n");
  | 11      return 0;
  | 12  }
  | 13
  | 14  void demo() {
  | 15      int arr[4];
  | 16
  | 17      fill_seq(arr);
  | 18
  | 19      for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++){
  | 20          printf("[%d]: %d\n", i, arr[i]);
  | 21      }
  | 22  }
  | 23
  | 24  #define END 8
  | 25  void fill_seq(int *a) {
  | 26      for(int i = 0; i < END; i++) {
  | 27          a[i] = (i+1) * 2;
  | 28      }
  | 29  }
  `----
  Compiling and running this code with gcc on a Linux system (and
  perhaps in other compiler/OS configurations) will yield the following
  kind of behavior.
  ,----
  | > gcc smash1.c
  | > ./a.out
  | About to do the demo
  | [0]: 2
  | [1]: 4
  | [2]: 6
  | [3]: 8
  | --- stack smashing detected ---: terminated
  | Aborted (core dumped)
  `----
  Describe the kind of error that is occurring in this code and why it
  is referred to as "stack smashing." Identify which part of the code is
  causing the problem.


B
~

  Consider the alternative file `smash2.c'.  Note the similarities to
  the previous program but also slight changes in it.  Compile and run
  this program and report what errors you see. Describe if the errors
  are similar or not and relate these to changes in the program.


C
~

  Recompile both smash programs as shown and use Valgrind to run them
  again. Show your output and comment on how much information Valgrind
  provides about each program run and the out-of-bounds array accesses
  that are performed.  Based on your observations, mention which memory
  area Valgrind monitors more effectively.

  ,----
  | > gcc -g smash1.c
  | > valgrind ./a.out
  | ...
  |
  | > gcc -g smash2.c
  | > valgrind ./a.out
  | ...
