PROBLEM 1: Two-Pass Input and malloc()
======================================

  One frequently encounters the following situation when reading files
  - The file contains some data that is to be read into a dynamically
    allocated array
  - There is no indication of how much data is in the file

  C programs commonly use a *two-pass* input strategy to handle this
  situation
  1. Read through the file once to count items in the file, then allocate
     memory for an array of that size
  2. Back up to the beginning of the file and read data from the file
     into the array

  The provided program `twopass.c' demonstrates this technique along
  with several other input / formatting techniques.


A
~
  Compile and run the `twopass.c' program on the two provided text files
  `nums1.txt' and `nums2.txt'.  Paste the output the program produces
  below.

  running num1.txt:
    Reading double values from file 'nums1.txt'
    [0] :     1.00 == 1.0000e+00
    [1] :     2.00 == 2.0000e+00
    [2] :     3.00 == 3.0000e+00
    [3] :     4.00 == 4.0000e+00
    [4] :     5.00 == 5.0000e+00
    [5] :     6.00 == 6.0000e+00
    [6] :     7.00 == 7.0000e+00
    [7] :     8.00 == 8.0000e+00
    [8] :     9.00 == 9.0000e+00
    [9] :    10.00 == 1.0000e+01
  running num2.txt:
    Reading double values from file 'nums2.txt'
    [0] :     4.35 == 4.3523e+00
    [1] : 37066.25 == 3.7066e+04
    [2] :   307.07 == 3.0707e+02
    [3] :     0.05 == 5.1072e-02
    [4] :   613.85 == 6.1385e+02
    [5] :  9443.33 == 9.4433e+03
    [6] : 84099.99 == 8.4100e+04
    [7] : 28202.73 == 2.8203e+04

B
~
  Examine the function `read_all_doubles()' in `twopass.c' and describe
  which lines/blocks of code carry out the following actions. Use the
  provided comments in the file as a guide.

  - Opens the file for reading and checks for errors : 11 ~ 14
  - Counts all the doubles in the file  : 16 ~ 24
  - Allocates memory for doubles in the file  : 26
  - Moves the file read position to the beginning of the file : 28
  - Closes the file when reading is complete : 33

C
~
  In your answer to the previous problem, you should have identified a
  use of `malloc()' in `read_all_doubles()'.  Where is this memory
  `free()''d and why?

  It's `free()'d at the main() function because if it makes no sense to free
  the memory in the `read_all_doubles()' function.

D
~
  Examine how the doubles read from file are printed in the `main()'
  function. Discuss below the format specifiers used by `printf()' and
  the width/precision modifiers that are used to get a "table-like"
  appearance.  You may wish to consult the Manual page on `printf()'
  such as the one here:

  <https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/printf.3.html>


PROBLEM 2: Binary Files
=======================

  Examine the `read_items.c' program and the provided input binary file
  `items.bin'.

A
~
  Open the `items.bin' file with a text editor (make sure not to modify any
  of the file's contents). What do you see? Are there any parts of the file
  that look understandable to you?

B
~
  Compile the `read_items.c' program and run it on the provided binary
  file `items.bin'. Paste the output below. How does this output relate
  to what you saw when you opened the file with an editor?

  output:
    82 of Item 'Hydra'
    7 of Item 'Arrow'
    2 of Item 'Swan'
    1 of Item 'Flame'
    3 of Item 'Pearl'
    14 of Item 'Orchid'
    9 of Item 'Staff'
    4 of Item 'Looking Glass'
    12 of Item 'Tempest'
    1 of Item 'Lamp Post'

C
~
  Examine the body of the `while' loop in the `main()' function. When working
  with binary files, we use `fread()' rather than `fscanf()' to read in a
  string value. However, we need information about the string's length so we
  know how many bytes to read.

  How did we learn of the length of the string representing each item's name in
  the binary file? What two things does this length help us do?
